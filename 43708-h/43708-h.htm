<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/fig003.png" width="349" height="282" alt="E" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ENTERING as we now are upon the publication of
a third volume of the "Current Notes," the
Second Volume of which we have herewith the
pleasure of presenting in a complete form to
the Public, our first duty as it is our pleasure
is to thank our Subscribers most cordially for
the very liberal support we have received from
them during its progress. It is so seldom
that the productions of the Customer and the
Tradesman form part of the same Periodical, that it is no wonder if the Publisher
of the "Current Notes" feels a little elated by seeing his humble efforts for the
entertainment of the Public in such good company. But this patronage, so far from
dulling his exertions in his legitimate pursuit&mdash;that of promoting the diffusion of Books
in their widest extent&mdash;will only stimulate him to fresh efforts, and while he continues
to place before his Customers the best Books, he trusts that they will be as liberal as
hitherto in their contributions of <i>Current Notes</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Price Current of Literature</i>, indeed, now occupies a position distinct from that
of any other Bookseller's Catalogue ever presented to the public, for it not only furnishes
a monthly list of the principal New Publications, followed by a constant succession of
Standard Works in every department of Ancient and Modern Literature, selected with
care and judgment, but it likewise presents a medium for Literary Inquirers to prosecute
their researches and interchange their opinions. Nor is this correspondence confined to
our own land. From the Colonies and America, over which it ranges in its wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
circulation, we continue to receive gratifying testimonials to its usefulness, as well as
accessions to its columns, and have reason to believe it is duly appreciated by those whose
favour it is our study to deserve and interest to secure.</p>

<p>The aim of the publisher has been to establish a literary organ of communication
amongst his numerous Subscribers and Friends, by inviting their correspondence, and
throwing open his columns to their inquiries and suggestions, and thus by propounding
queries, solving difficulties, and eliciting new facts, rendering some slight service to the
cause of Historical and Literary Truth. So cordially have they responded to this invitation,
that the task of selection has been sometimes a difficult, though always a pleasing one.
If there have been any communications from Correspondents which have not met with due
regard and consideration, it must be pleaded in apology that this miscellany of curious information
necessarily embraces so wide a field, that in gathering in the harvest it is not
surprising if a few ears of corn escape the gleaner's hand. If it be said that occasionally
too much notice has been taken of "unconsidered trifles," and that the objects regarded
were too minute and insignificant to justify the patient attention bestowed upon them;
the saying of Dr. Johnson may be adopted as a justification, that "the man who
removes the smallest obstacle in the pathway of Literature becomes its benefactor."
History is built up of fragments as the pyramid is formed of single stones; and
if we have only laid bare one doubtful point, or elucidated one novel fact,&mdash;if we
have but stripped off the moss clinging to some ruined archway of the past, or
decyphered one mouldering inscription,&mdash;then our work has been accomplished, and our
toil repaid.</p>

<p>The publisher wishes it to be distinctly understood that he is not the author of any
representations or opinions which may appear in the <i>Current Notes</i>. Every statement,
therefore, is open to correction or discussion, and the writers of the several paragraphs
must be considered alone responsible for their assertions. Holding himself aloof from
the bias of all personal interest or party feeling, the publisher can make due allowance
for difference of opinion, and like heralds in the tournament, after proclaiming the titles
of the respective champions, quietly retires and awaits the issue of the fray. If in the heat
of this literary joust of arms, the combatants have broken spears somewhat too hotly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
let it be remembered that he is only a spectator of the chivalrous feud&mdash;which, after all,
has for its sole object the rescue of Truth, in the words of the old knightly motto, "sans
tache et sans reproche."</p>

<p>It is a mournful task to record the death of the gifted&mdash;to follow Genius to its
grave. Our Obituary of the past year chronicles the death of many who were giants in
the realms of thought, and whom the world of science and learning could ill afford to
lose. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, of whom (as was said of Cæsar) it is difficult to decide whether he
fought or wrote with the greater spirit; Eliot <span class="smcap">Warburton</span>, the Historian and Novelist;
<span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>, the Naturalist; <span class="smcap">Scrope</span>, the Deerstalker; <span class="smcap">Johannot</span>, the Artist; the
gay and accomplished <span class="smcap">Count D'Orsay</span>; <span class="smcap">Landseer</span>, the Engraver; <span class="smcap">Mantell</span>, the
Geologist&mdash;are now numbered with the dead. <span class="smcap">Pugin</span>, too, has passed away&mdash;he, whose
whole life was but one continued aspiration after the Beautiful in Christian Art; the
harp of <span class="smcap">Moore</span> is silent, and awakens no echoes in the tomb.</p>

<p>Upon one occurrence of the past year, however, the publisher has particularly to
congratulate his Subscribers; namely the Free Trade movement which has broken up the
monopoly of the Booksellers' Association, increased the sale of books, and imparted new
vigour and activity to the cause of literature. Cheapness in the price of books becomes
an important auxiliary in the diffusion of knowledge. It is not merely a trade, but a social
question, on account of the power it possesses of advancing intellectual improvement.
The thirst for knowledge must be considerably influenced by the means we have at hand
to supply and satisfy its craving. Long before Lord Campbell pronounced his judgment,
the publisher was impressed with the truth of these views, and had steadily adhered to
them as the basis of his business. The recent Postal Regulations have also tended to facilitate
the purchase of books. By their means he has been enabled not only to forward
the <i>Price Current</i> to his Subscribers at a trifling cost, but to execute and transmit orders
from a thin pamphlet to a ponderous volume. Facilities of a like nature now exist for
sending books to the Colonies; and instead of being obliged to forward as heretofore,
even the smallest book as a package at a high charge for conveyance, any moderate-sized
volume, if left open at the ends, will reach its destination in the letter-bags, at a very
trifling cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The publisher thinks it not inappropriate to reprint in this place the following
<span class="smcap">Notice to Correspondents</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">G. Willis</span> begs to express his acknowledgments for the numerous interesting communications which have been
forwarded to him, and will feel obliged by the receipt of any original articles on subjects, either of a literary or an
antiquarian nature. Woodcuts, illustrative of subjects requiring them, will be executed at his expense.</p>

<p>All communications intended for insertion in the "<i>Current Notes</i>" must be accompanied by the Writer's real
name and address, which are merely required as a guarantee of his good faith, and not for publication, except at his
desire.</p></blockquote>

<p>While cordially reiterating the sentiments expressed in the first of the preceding
paragraphs, the publisher can assure his Subscribers that the work, intended as a boon
to themselves, has proved an equal source of gratification to him; and so, with mutual
good wishes, trusts they may long continue, in the words of Milton, "with plain and
lightsome brevity to relate well and orderly things worth the noting."</p>

<h2>NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS</h2>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">To the "Price Current of Literature."</span></div>


<p><span class="smcap">G. Willis</span> gratefully acknowledges the various interesting
documents and letters he has received. He is anxious
that it should be perfectly understood that he is not the
author of any statement, representation, or opinion, that
may appear in his "Current Notes," which are merely selections
from communications made to him in the course of
his business, and which appear to him to merit attention.
Every statement therefore is open to correction or discussion,
and the writers of the several paragraphs should be
considered as alone responsible for their assertions. Although
many notes have hitherto appeared anonymously,
or with initial letters, yet wherever a serious contradiction
is involved, G. Willis trusts that his Correspondents will
feel the necessity of allowing him to make use of their
names when properly required.</p>

<p>Do not you think a very interesting work
might be written, to be entitled an Historical Account
of the celebrated Villas in the neighbourhood of London.
I mean rather the Villas that have been&mdash;than those

<p>Look at Horace Walpole's Song on Strawberry Hill.
How many places are there mentioned which have historical
recollections connected with them, which it
would be worth preserving.</p>

<p>There must be always great interest about the localities

and a hundred others&mdash;many with very curious anecdotes
of local and personal history connected with them.</div>

<p>Perhaps I overrate the interest with which such a
book would be read. I certainly do not, if it would
equal that, with which I myself read the account of
places in the neighbourhood of Paris, remarkable in
history, but the traces of which&mdash;many of which at

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;As it
appears from the
public Prints
that the late
eminent artist,
J. M. W. Turner,
never sat for
his Portrait;&mdash;and
the only
likenesses of
him were taken
by stealth,
I send you
a rude sketch
which I took of
him in the same
way, about the
year 1805 or 6.
He was then on
a visit at Mr.
Fawkes's, of
Farnley, where
a number of
grouse shooters
had assembled,&mdash;and
Turner
had adopted the
garb of a sportsman.
His appearance,
as well as his exploits on the moors, were the
subject of much mirth.</p>

<p>One day we accompanied him on an excursion, for
the purpose of taking a sketch of the magnificent scenery
of Gordale, in Craven, from which he afterwards produced
a finished painting.</p>

<p>My rude sketch of his person was considered a
characteristic resemblance at the time; and though it
has the air of a caricature, yet was not meant as such
when it was drawn.</p>

<p>If you think it would interest the readers of your
"Current Notes," you will perhaps give it as an illustration.
If not, I will thank you to return it to me.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Monumental Brasses Removed from the Churches
of Fulham and Chelsea.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Geo. Willis</span>,&mdash;Your Correspondent, under the
head of "Antiquarian Sacrilege," (<i>Current Notes for
December, p. 91,</i>) seems not to be aware that almost
all Church Brasses, with very few exceptions, were torn
from their places by the sectarian soldiers in Cromwell's
time, who affected to consider such things idolatrous.
They were for the most part sold for old brass, and
some authority (I forget who at this moment), tells us
that, in consequence of the number at one time brought
into the market, the price of brass was decreased in
proportion. There were very few Antiquaries in those
days, consequently a very small number of these desecrated
Brasses have been preserved, and for those we
possess we are indebted to such men as Ashmole, Lilly,
and others of that class, who, though sufficiently fantastic
and visionary in their pursuits, were still men of
some learning and taste.</p>

<p>Some, if not the whole of the lots alluded to by your
Correspondent, came into the possession of the late John
Meyrick, Esq., through an ancestor of his wife, whose
name was "Rush," and the only sacrilege committed by
the late Mr. Meyrick seems to have been the preservation
of these things from destruction.</p>

<p>I have frequently heard the late Sir S. R. Meyrick
mention these Brasses, and regret they were not in his
possession.</p>

<p>I was rejoiced at the first glance at F. C. B.'s communication
(p. 88 "Current Notes" for November),
but doubts very soon arose, whether some oversight had
not occurred in taking the portrait of <i>Robert</i> Bertie,
for that enquired after, which is <i>Montague</i> Bertie.
On turning to Granger I found this to be the case, for
the portrait which F. C. B. has, is there given as <i>Robert</i>,
so that I fear the right one remains yet <i>non est inventus</i>,
for I do not consider "A Dealer," as speaking
from any distinct recollection of such a portrait, which
must be an 8vo. one, whereas Faithorne's is in 4to.</p>

as it is from the late Mr. Hood's daughter, who is married
to the Rev. S. Broderip, Rector of Cossington,

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;For the information of your two correspondents,
"A Subscriber," and "R. O. W." ("Current
Notes" for December, p. 95), I beg to repeat my assertion
that there was an edition of "The Holy Court,"
by N. Caussin, published in <i>Corke</i>. In fact, (if I mistake
not), there were two editions, one in 1765, without
plates; and one in 1767, with very excellent plates. I
can procure an imperfect copy of the former for either
of your correspondents for one shilling; and a fine copy
of the latter for thirty to thirty-five shillings, full calf,
with plates.</p>

<p>The work was printed in Broad-lane&mdash;(perhaps so
called quasi "lucus a non lucendo," as the lane is certainly
rather narrow)&mdash;and was very well got up. The
date and place of printing are thus given in the first
edition: Corke: "Printed anno Domini 1765."</p>

The tomb is a much more highly ornate specimen of an

there are the ruins of an old Romanesque church, which
was dedicated to St. Berichert or Berihert, a Saxon,
whose name is now Anglicised into Benjamin, and whose
death is recorded at <small>A.D.</small> 839, in the Four Masters.
The Legend on the stone is in Latin, (but very sorry

Wardrobe Roll for the Coronation of Richard III.,
July 3rd, 1483, (published in the Antiquarian Repertory,
Vol. I. p. 29, 1807;) "<i>The deliveree of divers
Stuff delivered for the use of Lorde Edwarde, son of
late Kyng Edward the Fourthe, and of his Henxemen?</i>"
Then follows a particular account of the materials

present at his uncle's coronation? There is no mention

Henry VII., says, the young princes were murdered in
July, 1483. If the words did not expressly state "<i>Edwarde,

should have concluded that it meant Richard III.'s

about nine years of age.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">American Testimonial to Mrs. Cowden Clarke.</span></h2>


<div class='right'>
New York, 13th December, 1851.<br />
</div>

<p>About the time you receive this, you will probably
hear of an American testimonial to that amiable woman,
Mrs. Cowden Clarke, to be presented to her by the
American Minister, Mr. Abbot Lawrence, in the name
of the subscribers, at the head of whom stands America's
greatest and best statesman, Daniel Webster.</p>

<p>This testimonial is in the shape of a magnificent
Rosewood Library Chair, richly carved, and covered
with the finest French Satin Brocade. It is at this
moment <i>on</i> the Atlantic, <i>in</i> the "Atlantic," and insured
by the Atlantic Insurance Company, for three hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">the fame of Shakspere</span> is world-wide, subscriptions
of five dollars each came in from all parts of
the American Union&mdash;from the most northerly of all,
Maine,&mdash;to Mexico. From Wisconsin, in the <i>far</i>-far-<small>FAR</small>
West, to the shores of the Pacific, at San Francisco&mdash;they
are thousands of miles apart from each other.</p>

<p>Why have you left it to us poor Yankees "to take
the wind out of your sails," in presenting a testimonial
to the authoress of the Concordance to Shakspere?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Mr. Payne Collier, and such like dear fellows, who
know so many eminent wealthy literati, ought, <i>now</i> that
we have set you the example, to get up a subscription, and
present Mrs. Clarke with some better Shaksperean testimonial
than a Chair! What say you to a '<span class="smcap">First</span>' Best
Bed? But if the hangings of it beat our satin brocade
cover, why I'll hang myself in despair&mdash;no I won't, but
I'll eat it&mdash;bed&mdash;feathers and all. The Chair was to
have been covered with the richest silk Genoa velvet, of
a regal scarlet or crimson, but the lady of our Secretary
of State, Mrs. Daniel Webster, would have it, that
velvet covers were quite old-fashioned; and as ladies
best know what will suit ladies, she was asked the favour
to select the cover, and <i>I guess</i> you will admire it.</p>

<p>Now for the <i>freedom</i> of America. Collins gave the
Chair <i>free</i> passage. Edwards, Sandford and Co. conveyed
the case to the ship, and will convey it from
Liverpool to London, <i>free</i>. They are Express men, and
thus do we "go a-head."</p>

<p>G. W.'s Correspondent adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I receive your 'Notes' regularly. The story about
Katy Hayes in your November Number, p. 88, is somewhat
embellished by '<i>your New York Special Reporter</i>.'
I regret to tell you that she, poor girl, has
quite <i>put her foot in it</i> here, and I am afraid will
return poorer than when she came. She or her agent
or agents, pursued a silly course by, <i>it is said</i>, keeping
almost open house to her countrymen at the Astor house,
a very expensive hotel, where she ran up an enormous
bill, and being unable to pay, the sheriff's officers carried
off the receipts at some of her concerts&mdash;particularly that
which she gave for that humbug hypocrite Father
Mathew. There has been a great deal about it in our
papers. Doctor Joy returned to England some time ago
in disgust. Mathew absolutely had the temerity to
make it appear that he could work miracles, <i>publicly</i>,
in the face of a large Catholic congregation, by restoring
the sick and lame to health!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethnology.</span>&mdash;"G.W.'s New York Special Reporter,"
whose embellished style has been questioned in the preceding

received, "giving an account of a <i>pretended</i> journey to
the city of Eximaya, in Central America, by an Englishman
and two Spaniards, who are all 'gone dead.'"
Observing that, "It is a good Arabian Night's hoax.
You will see," he remarks, "the pamphlet is dated
1850, but the children have only been exhibited here
this week. There is <i>no mistake</i> about them, they are
evidently children of a distinct and unknown race, come
from whence they will. The recession of their foreheads
is extraordinary. Their heads are wonderfully small,
and in exact proportion to their bodies and limbs. They
are not dwarfs but pigmies; about twelve years of age,
lively and playful. They are not at Barnum's Museum,
but at the rooms of the Society Library, and are exciting
very great attention."</p>

century; which may be found attached to the iron
frame of casement windows in many old farm houses.</p>

<p>A latch is not a turnbuckle, and no ironmonger's
apprentice would confound the two. A latch is a bar
moving up and down in a limited space&mdash;or, if backwards
and forwards, as in some locks&mdash;it is called the
latch-bolt. A turnbuckle, as its name implies, turns
round, and is only limited by the notch, &amp;c. by which it
holds. They are chiefly of two kinds: one is a spindle,
with a knob or ring at one end, and a tongue or buckle
at the other; another is a handle with a tongue attached,
moving together freely round, upon a pin or
rivets. This latter kind has taken the place of the
casement latch represented in your "Current Notes"
in present use.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Rowland Hill and the Penny Postage.</span></h2>


<p>The following is the commencement of a leading
article on the Penny Postage, contained in the "<i>Times</i>,"
of Saturday, 9th August, 1851:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A traveller sauntering through the Lake districts of
England some years ago, arrived at a small public-house
just as the postman stopped to deliver a letter. A young
girl came out to receive it. She took it in her hand,
turned it over and over, and asked the charge. It was a
large sum&mdash;no less than a shilling. Sighing heavily, she
observed that it came from her brother, but that she was
too poor to take it in, and she returned it to the postman
accordingly. The traveller was a man of kindness as well
as of observation; he offered to pay the postage himself,
and in spite of more reluctance on the girl's part than he
could well understand, he did pay it, and gave her the
letter. No sooner, however, was the postman's back
turned, than she confessed that the proceeding had been
concerted between her brother and herself, that the letter
was empty, that certain signs on the direction conveyed all
she wanted to know, and that as they could neither of
them afford to pay postage, they had devised this method
of franking the intelligence desired. The traveller pursued
his journey, and as he plodded over the Cumberland
fells, he mused upon the badness of a system which drove
people to such straits for means of correspondence, and
defeated its own object all the time. With most men such
musings would have ended before the close of the hour,
but this man's name was <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, and it was from
this incident and these reflections that the whole scheme of
Penny Postage was derived."</p></blockquote>

<p>I should be glad to know if there is any doubt as to
the truth of this statement, as I fancied it had been
contradicted. Could any of your Correspondents oblige
me by giving me information on the subject, I should
feel obliged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capping a Story.</span>&mdash;Rogers, the poet, was fond of
telling the story of a gentleman who lost a shilling in
Covent Garden Market, just at the corner of the Great
Piazza, and on his return from India some five-and-twenty
years afterwards, on passing the spot where he
supposed the loss had taken place, remembered the circumstance,
and looking about him on the pavement,
picked up his shilling. Here Rogers, in his own inimitable
way of telling a story, would pause, and then add&mdash;"<span class="smcap">In
halfpence</span>, <i>wrapped up in paper</i>."</p>

<p>"I knew the man," said a witty friend to the poet,
"but you have forgotten the most singular point of the
story about the recovery of this lost shilling <i>just at the
door of Willis the bookseller's place of business</i>."</p>

<p>"I thought it sufficiently odd," replied the poetical
banker, "our friend having found his shilling after so
long a period, and only wish that my lost notes may turn
up again in the same unexpected and amusing manner&mdash;<i>that
notes turn up to me from Willis</i>."</p>

<p>"Then you must have heard the whole story, and the
very remarkable fact to which I refer? That in the
paper which contained the four-and-twenty halfpence he
found another filled with farthings, the exact amount of
which when calculated, proved to be that of compound
interest upon the shilling for five-and-twenty years one
month and thirteen days."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Prints of Oliver Cromwell and "St. Luke's
Day."</span></h2>


<p>A "Young Print and Portrait Collector" would be
obliged by any explanation respecting a portrait of
Oliver Cromwell, of an allegorical nature, surrounded
by various emblems and devices, which evidently bear
upon the events of his life. He is represented standing
between two columns, in armour, with a wreath of laurel
in place of a helmet. This print has neither name or
date of any kind upon it.</p>

<p>Another print is one marked published 1816,
by J. T. Smith, called "St. Luke's day," a
"poor painter removing;" is this intended as
a caricature upon some artist of the time?</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Admission of Literary Inquirers to the Public
Records.</span></h2>


<p>Regulations under which permission will be given
to Literary Inquirers to make searches among the Public
Records, without payment of fees, contained in a letter
addressed by the Right Honourable Sir John Romilly,
Master of the Rolls to Sir Francis Palgrave, K.H., the
Deputy Keeper of the Public Records: dated at the
Rolls House, 4th December, 1851:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the individuals seeking to avail themselves
of the permission shall address a letter to the Deputy
Keeper, stating generally their objects of research, so as
to show that the applications are really and <i>bonâ fide</i> for
literary purposes, and that the applicant shall also
attend the Deputy Keeper personally thereon, and give
such further explanation as may be required; and that
thereupon the Deputy Keeper shall, if he be satisfied
with the statement and explanation, authorise the Assistant
Keepers to allow the applicant to inspect such
Indexes of Records, and also such Original Records, and
to make such copies or extracts in pencil required by the
applicant as the Deputy Keeper may think advisable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This mode of proceeding, which is equally required for
the security of the Records, and for the protection of
the business searchers, will in fact be beneficial to
Literary Inquirers; for the more fully they explain their
objects, the better will the Deputy Keeper and the
other officers be able to direct them to the documents
which may be useful to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>2ndly. That all the applications before mentioned be
entered in a book, and be reported to the Master of the
Rolls.</p>

<p>3rdly. That a book be kept at each branch office, in
which the Assistant Keeper shall enter a note or particular
of the Rolls, Records, Books, or Documents, called
for, inspected, or used by the applicant, nearly in the
same manner, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, as is practised with
respect to Manuscripts in the British Museum.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But this book is to be considered as confidential, and not
to be shown to the public without express permission
of the Master of the Rolls or Deputy Keeper.</p></blockquote>

<p>4thly. That, in case of any impropriety or abuse of the
privilege, the Assistant Keepers do forthwith report the
same to the Deputy Keeper, in order that he may bring
the same before the Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p>It will be necessary also to explain to the Literary
Inquirers that the time of the various officers and other
persons employed in the Public Record Office is so wholly
engrossed by the performance of their present duties,
that it will not be possible for the officers to assist any
Literary Inquirers beyond the production of the documents,
and giving a general explanation, if needed, of
their character and nature. No applicant ought to present
himself who is not sufficiently acquainted with the
hand-writing, abbreviations, and language of ancient
documents, so as to be able to read and decipher their
contents.</p>

<p>The Literary Inquirer will have free access to the
documents, but, this being done, he will have to conduct
the inquiry from these documents in such manner as his
own knowledge and capacity may best enable him to do.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p><i>G. W. is informed that the reading Public are indebted
to John Bruce, Esq., the Treasurer of the
Society of Antiquaries, for this important concession
on the part of the Master of the Rolls; and it has
been suggested that a suitable testimonial should be
presented to Mr. Bruce by those historical inquirers
who are likely to derive such valuable aid from his
exertions.</i></p>

<p>Of this singular Ascetical Romance, M. Van Praet states
that six copies are known as being printed on vellum: of
these three are in the National Library at Paris, all of which
are more or less adorned with miniatures, two of them,
like the present, having the summary of the chapters (left
blank for the insertion of the miniatures) written in a
contemporary hand on the margins. The Harleian copy,
afterwards in the collections of Count Macarthy and Mr.
Hibbert, was adorned with thirteen miniatures: the present
beautiful volume has <small>SIXTEEN</small>, the additional ones
being at the commencement of the chapters, in which the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
